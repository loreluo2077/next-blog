### Introduction

LetterGPT is a virtual company created by me (Yunfan) alone. In 2024, during the rapid development of AI, I had an initial idea: would it be possible to establish virtual AI employees and have them work together to operate a company?

In this company, I am the only human entity, taking on the role of decision-maker. I create virtual employees and assign them different positions and skills, and they are responsible for breaking down and completing tasks.

That was just an initial idea, but now witnessing the rapid development of agents and the increasing power of AI programming, I think I can give it a try. Life is short, why not give it a shot?

### Company Vision
- Create interesting and profitable products
- Explore ways to collaborate with virtual employees
